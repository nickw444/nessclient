A python implementation/abstraction of the [Ness D8x / D16x Serial Interface ASCII protocol](./D8-32X%20Serial%20Protocol%20Public.pdf)
## Installing nessclient

`nessclient` is available directly from pip:

```sh
pip install nessclient
```

## Documentation

The full documentation can be found at [Read the Docs](https://nessclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## CLI

This package includes a CLI which uses the library to interface with the Ness Serial Interface. You can read more in [the docs](https://nessclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html)

To use the CLI you must install it's dependencies by installing it with extras for `cli`:

```
pip install nessclient[cli]
ness-cli --help
```

The CLI exposes several high level commands:

- `events` – listen for alarm events emitted by a connected panel. Use `--interactive` for a terminal UI with live zone status and event logs.
- `send` – send a raw command to the panel.
- `server` – run a dummy panel server, useful for local development when an alarm panel isn't available.
- `version` – print the installed package version.

Run `ness-cli COMMAND --help` for full options on each command.

### Capturing raw packets

When reporting issues it can be helpful to provide the raw ASCII packets
exchanged with the panel. The `events` command accepts a `--logfile` option that
records each transmitted (`TX`) and received (`RX`) packet:

```sh
ness-cli events --logfile packets.log
```

This works in both normal and `--interactive` modes. Include the generated log
file with bug reports to assist with troubleshooting.

## Developing

For a quick development setup, install dependencies and tooling with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```
uv sync --dev --all-extras
```

Before submitting changes, ensure code is formatted, linted, type-checked and tested:

```
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy --strict nessclient
uv run pytest
```

See the [Developing](https://nessclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html) section in the docs for more details on contributing and environment setup.
